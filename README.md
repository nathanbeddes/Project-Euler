# Project Euler

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a series of math based programming
problems. I'm tackling as many problems as possible to have fun exploring
mathematics and to implement solutions in programming languages I'd like to
become familiar with.

## Directory Structure

From the top level, each directory is numbered by the
[problem](http://projecteuler.net/problems) I attempt to solve. Each
subdirectory is named by the programming language I implement the solution in.
