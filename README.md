# Project Euler

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a series of math based programming
problems. I'm tackling as many problems as possible to have fun exploring
mathematics and to implement solutions in programming languages I'd like to
become familiar with.

## Directory Structure

Each sub-directory is named after the programming language I implement the
solution for each [problem](http://projecteuler.net/problems) in.
